Declare a variable called x of type Integer (Don't forget your semicolons!)~intx;~Looks good! Here comes your next challenge.~google.com~3
Assign 3 to the variable you defined above.~x=3;~Variable defined.~google.com~3
Foo is to Function based programming as Bar is to...?~ObjectOrientedDesign~Very interesting my friend.~google.com~1
Define a String Variable foo~Stringfoo;~Looking good! Let's move on~Sorry, that's not correct~3
Assign the string "Hello World" to the variable foo~foo="HelloWorld";~You're on fire!~Almost, keep trying~3
Define a Double variable bar~Doublebar;~Attakid! Lets move to the next questions~Not quite.. check out google for help~3
Assign the value to 12.56 to the variable bar~bar=12.56;~Looking good!~Looking not so good!~3
Write an if statement that will check if bar = 12.56.  If true, print foo to the console~if(bar==12.56){System.Console.WriteLine(foo);}~Looks good!~hmm... that's not right~3
Define a Boolean Variable called check~Booleancheck;~Nice one! Moving on....~Not so good, trying googling "Boolean declaration in C#"~3
Assign true to the variable called check~check=true;~Awesome job!~Not so awesome job! Have you heard of google?~3
Next define an if statement that checks if the variable check is true. The body of the If statment does not matter.~if(check==true){}~Nice, that was an easy one~C'mon, this is supposed to be easy~3
Next, Define a Boolean Variable isValid~BooleanisValid;~Looking good~ WRONG!!~3
Assign false to the boolean variable isValid.~isValid=false;~Nice One!~Try again~3
Define a integer variable y~inty;~Good Job!~Bad Job!~3
Assign 1 to the variable y.~y=1;~Good Job!~WRONG!~3
Next, define an if statement that checks if the variable isValid is true. If isValid is true add 2 to the variable y~if(isValid==true){y+=2;}~Hey! Perfect!~Hey, that doesn't look right~3
